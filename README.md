Hello, my name is Muhammad Arham Siddiqui. I was an ACCA student with a strong passion for learning Python and pursuing a career in artificial intelligence. Despite my background in business, I am drawn to the rapidly growing tech industry and the immense potential of AI. I have taken the initiative to self-study Python, utilizing resources such as ChatGPT and YouTube to grasp the fundamentals. While I am not currently enrolled in any formal institution, I am dedicated to mastering the language and expanding my skills in AI. My GitHub profile reflects my ongoing journey of learning and experimentation in Python and AI-related projects. I am eager to contribute to the field of artificial intelligence and am committed to continuous learning and professional growth.
